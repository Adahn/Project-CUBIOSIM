# Project-CUBIOSIM
University project aiming to improve the performance in the calculation of biological systems

## File Structure
    - cuRk4 : Parallelised version of the runge-kutta method (RK4) using CUDA, check out the README.txt in this directory to get started
    - fdm : TODO LILIANE
    - odeint : TODO LILIANE, ELISE, LUCAS ?
    - read : TODO ELISE
    - rk4 : Sequential version of runge-kutta method (RK4) to solve biological systems, check out the README.txt in this directory to get started
    - sources: Collection of helpful articles, presentations, etc.

## Requirements
CUDA requirements: TODO LUCAS
Other requirements to use your programs ELise / Liliane ??

## Getting started
If you want to check the sequential version of the Runge-Kutta method solvers, check out the directory rk4 and read the README.txt

If you want to check out the parallelised version of the Runge-Kutta method solver, check out the directory cuRk4 and read the README.txt

LILIANE, ELISE how to use your programs? add explanation please :)
